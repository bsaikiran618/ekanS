# ekanS - Snake but reversed!
**You put the apple, the computer controls the snake.**

The point is for me to write a good algorithm such that given 
a some apples placed by the user on the grid, the snake will
follow an optimal path to eat all the apples without dying, in
the minimum time.

There are a few variations of the problem that I want to try out:
- User places all the apples first and then snake starts
- User can place apples dynamically as the snake eats them
- Having obstacles on the grid
- etc.

There are quite a few approaches that I want to try. This project is
mostly just a self-indulgent musing. Nothing profound.
All critiques will be ignored passionately.
